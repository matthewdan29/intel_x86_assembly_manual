The stack containded in a segment and identified by the segment selector in the SS register. 
When using flat memory model, The stack can be loacted anywhere in the linear address space for the program. 
Iteams are placed on the stack using the PUSH instrction and removed from the stack using the POP instruction. 
When an item is pushed onto the stack, the processor decrements the ESP register, then writes the item at the new top of stack. 
WHen an item is popped off the stack, the processor reads the item from the top of stack, then increments the ESP register. 
In this manner, the stack grows down in memory (towards lesser addresses ) when items are pushed on the stack and shrink up (towards greater addresses) when the items are popped from the stack. (Think of when you at a buffet and you take a plate from the plate rack and when the waiter reloads the plates thats the best way to think of it )

A program or operating system/executive can set up many stacks. 

When a system set up many stacks, only one stack -- the current stack is available at a time. 
The current stack is the one contained in the segment referenced by the SS register.

The processor references the SS register automatically for all stack operations. 
When the ESP register is used as a memory address, it automatically points to an ddress on the current stack. 
Also, the CALL, RET, PUSH, POP, ENTER, and LEAVE instructions all perform operations on the current stack
