Prior to branching to the first instruction of the called procedure, the CALL instruction pushes the address in the EIP register onto the current stack. 
THis address is then called the return-instruction pointer and it points to the instruction where execution of the calling provedure should resume following a return fromthe called procedure. 
Upon returning from a caleed procedure, the RET instruction pops the return-instruction pointer from the stack back into the EIP register. 
Execution of the calling procedure then resumes. 

The processor does not keep track of the location of the return-instyruction pointer. 
A common way to reset the stack pointer to the point to the return-instruction pointer is to move the contents of the EBP register onto the ESP register. 
If the EBP register is loaded with the stack pointer immediately following a procedure call, it should point to the return instruction pointer on the stack.

The processor does not require that the return instruction pointer point back to the calling procedure.
