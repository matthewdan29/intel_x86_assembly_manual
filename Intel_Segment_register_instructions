The processor provides a variety of instructions that address the segment registers of the processor directly. 
These instructions are only used when an operating system executive is using the segmented or the real-address mode memory momory mode. 

These instructions are divided into subordiate subgroups of instructions that allow: 

1) Segment-register load and store. 

2) Far control transfers 

3) software interrupts calls

4)handling of far pointers
