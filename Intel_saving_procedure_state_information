The Processor does not save the contents of the general-purpose registers, segment registers, or the EFLAGS register on a procedure call. 
A calling procedure should explicitly save the values in any of the general-purpose registers that it will need when it resumes execution after a return. 
These values can be saved on the stack or in memory in one of the data segments. 

The PUSHA and POPA instructions facilitate saving and restoring the contents of the general-purpose registers. 
PUSHA pushes the values in all the general-purpose registers on the stack in the following order: 
1) EAX

2) ECX

3) EDX

4) EBX

5) ESP (the value proir to executing the PUSHA instruction)

6) EBP

7) ESI

8) EDI

The POPA instruction pops all the register values saved with a PUSHA instruction (except the ESP value) from the stack to their respective registers. 

If a called procedure changes the state of any of the segment registers explicitly, it should restore them to their former values before executing a return to the calling procedure. 

If a calling procedure needs to maintain the state of the EFLAGS register, it can save and restore all or part of the register using the PUSHF/PUSHFD and POPF/POPFD instructions. 
The PUSHF instruction pushes the lower word of the EFLAGS register on the stack, while the PUSHFD instruction pushes the entire regiseter. 
The POPF instruction pops a word from the stack into the lower word of the EFLAGS register, while the POPFD instrucion pops a double word from the stack into the register.
