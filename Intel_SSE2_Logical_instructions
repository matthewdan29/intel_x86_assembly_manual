Intel SSE2 logical instructions perform AND, AND NOT, OR, and XOR operations on packed double precision floating-point values 

ANDPD		Perform bitwise logical AND of packed double precision floating-point values 

ANDNPD 		Perfrom bitwise logical AND NOT of packed double precision floating-point values 

ORPD		Perform bitwise logical OR of packed double precision floating-point values 

XORPD 		Perform bitwise logical XOR of packed double precision floating-point values
