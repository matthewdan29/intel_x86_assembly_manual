The processor provides two mechanisms for interrupting program execution, interrupts, and excepetions: 

1) An interrupt is an asynchronous event that is typically triggered by an I/O device. 

2) An exception is a synchronous event that is generated when the processor detects one or more predefined conditions while executing an instrution. There are 3 class of exceptions 
	1) faults
	2) traps 
	3) aborts

The processor responds to interrupts and exceptions in essentially the same way. 
When an interrupt or exception is signaled, the processor halts execution of the current program or task and switches to a handler procedure that has been written specifically to handle the interrupt or exception condition. 
The processor accesses the handler procedure through an entry in the interrupt descriptor table (IDT). 
When the handler has completed handling the interrupt or exception, program control is returned to the interrupted program or task. 
The operating system, executive, and/or device drivers normally handle interrupts and exceptions independently from application programs or tasks. 
Application programs can, however, access the interrupt and exception handelers incorporated in an operating system or executive through assembly-language calls. 


When the processor detects an interrupt or exception, it does one of the following things: 

1) Executes an implicit call to a handler procedure. 

2) executes an implicit call to a handler task
