The INT n (software interrupt), INTO (interrupt on overflow), and BOUND (detect value out of range) instructions allow a program to explicity raise a specified interrupt or exception, which in turn causes the handler routine for the interrupt or exception to be called. 

The INT n instruction can raise any of the processor's interrupts or exceptions by encoding the vector of the interrupt or exception in the instruction. 
This instruction can be used to support software generated interrupts or to test the operation of interrupt and exception handlers. 

The IRET (return from interrupt) instrucion returns program control from an interrupt handler to the interrupted procedure. 
The IRET instruction performs a simialr operation to the RET instruction. 

The CALL (call procedure) and RET (return from procedure) instructions allow a jump from one procedure to another and a subsequent return to the calling procedure. 
EFLAGS register contents are automatically stored on the stack along with the return instruction pointer when the processor services an interrupt. 

The INTO instruction raises the overflow exception if the OF flag is set. 
If the flag is clear, execution continues without raising the exception. 
This instruction allow software to access the overflow exception handler explicitly to check for overflow conditions. 

The BOUND instruction compares a signed value against upper and lower bounds, and raises the "BOUND rage exceeded" exception if the value is less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound. 
This instruction is useful for operation such as checking an array index to make sure it falls within the range defined for the array.
