In 64-bit mode, the operand size for all near branches (CALL, RET, JCC, JCXZ, JMP, and LOOP) is forced to 64-bits. 
The listed instructions update the 64-bit RIP without need for a REX operand-size prefix. 

Near branches in the following operations are forced to 64-bits (regardless of operand size prefixes): 

1) Truncation of the size of the instruction pointer

2) Size of a stack pop or push, due to CALL or RET

3) Size of a stack-pointer increment or decrement, due to CALL or RET

4) Indirect-branch operand size

Note that the displacement field for relative branches is still limited to 32 bits and the address size for near branches is not forced. 

Address size determines the register size (CCX/ECX/RCX) used for JCXZ and LOOP. t
It also impacts the address calculation for memory indirect branches. 
Addresses size is 64 bit by default, although it can be over-ridden to 32 bits (using a prefix).
