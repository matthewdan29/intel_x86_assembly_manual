When executing the near call, the processor does: 

1) Pushes the current value of the EIP register on the stack 

	If the shado stack is enabled and the displacment value is not 0, pushes the current value of the EIP register on the shadow stack. 

2) Loads the offset of the called procedure in the EIP register. 

3) Begings execution of the called procedure. 

When the executing a near return, the processor perfroms these actions: 

1) Pops the top-of-stack value (return instruction pointer) into the EIP register. 

2) if the RET instruction has an optional n argument, increments the stack pointer by the number of bytes specified with the n operand to release parameters from the stack. 

3) Resumes executionof the calling procedure
