The BSF (bit scan forward) and BSR (bit scan reverse) instructions scan a bit string in a source operand for a set bit and store the bit index of the first set bit found in a destination register. 
The bit index is the offset from the least significant bit (bit 0) in the bit string to the first set bit. 
The BSF instruction scans the source operand low-to-high (from bit 0 of the source operand toward the most significant bit); the BSR instruction scans high-to-low (from the most significant bit toward the least significant bit).
