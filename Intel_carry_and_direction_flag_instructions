The STC (set carry flag), CLC (clear carry flag), and CMC (complement carry flag) instructions allow the CF flag in the EFLAGS register to be modified directly. 
They are typically used to initialize the CF flag to a known state before an instruction that uses the flag in an operation is executed. 
They are also used in conjunction with the rotate-with-carry instructions (RCL and RCR). 

The STD (set direction flag) and CLD (clear direction flag) instructions allow the DF flag in the EFLAGS register to be modified directly. 
The DF flag determines the direction in whic index registers ESI and EDI are stepped when executing string processing instructions. 
If the DF flag is clear, the index registers are incremented after each iteration of a string instruction; if the DF flag is set, the registers are decremented.
