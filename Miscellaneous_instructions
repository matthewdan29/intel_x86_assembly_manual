The Miscellaneous instructions provide such function as loading an effective address, executing a "no-operation," and retrieving processor identification information

LEA		Load effective address

NOP		No operation 

UD 		Undefined instructions

XLAT/XLATB	Table lookup translation

CPUID 		Processor identification

MOVBE		Move data after swapping data bytes 

PREFETCHW	Prefetch data into chche in anticipation of write

PREFETCHWT1	Prefetch hint T1 with intent to write 

CLFUSH		Flushes and invalidates a memory operand and its associated cache line from all levels of the processor's cache hierarchy. 

CLFLUSHOPT 	Flucshes and invalidates a memory operand and its associated cache line from all levels of the processor's cache hierarchy with optimized memory system throughput
