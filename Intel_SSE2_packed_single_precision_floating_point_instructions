Intel SSE2 packed single precision floating-point instructions perform conversion operations on single precision floating-point and integet operands. 
These instructions represent enhancements to the Intel SSE single precision floating-point instructions. 

CVTDQ2PS 		Convert packed doubleword integers to packed single precision flaoting-point values 

CVTPS2DQ		Convert packed single precision flaoting-point values to packed doubleword integers 

CVTTPS2DQ		Convert with truncation packed single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers
