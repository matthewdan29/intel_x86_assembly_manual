Intel Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel AMX) is a built-in accelerator designed to significantly enhance AI capabilites on Intel Xeon Scalable processors. 
Intel AMX is specifically designed to improve the performance of deep learning training and inference on the CPU. 
It is ideal for workloads such as natural language processing (NLP), recommendation systems(check my github i have a project that will help you understand the highlevel view of this), image recognition, and other AI
