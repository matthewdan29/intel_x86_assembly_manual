The bit test and modify instructions operate on a single bit, which can be in an operand. 
The location of the bit is specified as an offset from the least significant bit of the operand. 
When the processor identifies the bit to be tested and modified, it first loads the CF flag with the current value of the bit. 
Then it assigns a new value to the selected bit, as determined by the modify operation of the instruction. 

Personally I use the selected bit shift a lot becuase I use C++ for as my main lang. albit, I'm going to use double shifts a lot more because I dont like typing out 30 to 50 bit shifts in a matrix calculation.
