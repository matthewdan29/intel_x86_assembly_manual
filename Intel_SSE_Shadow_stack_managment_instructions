Shadow stack management instructions allow the program and run-time to perform operations like recovering from control protections faults, shadow stack switching, etc. 

Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) introduces the concept of a shadow stack. 
When configured to do so, the CPU uses shadow stacks to ensure the conrrectness of certain control-flow transfers. 
Some control-flow transfers update a shadow stack with multiple accesses, including modification of a stack element called "supervisor shadow-stack token (henceforth token)". A shadow stack's token includes a bit that indicates wheater the shdow stack is in use or busy. 
Such shadow-stack updates are said to be complex. 
Typically, a complex shadow stack updates pertain only to the shadow stacks used by supervisor software (software operating when the current privilege level -- CPL -- is 0).
Certain events encountered during the complex shadow-stack update can cause the shadow stack to become prematurely busy, meaning that the update fails to complete but has marked the shadow stack "busy". 
Prematurely busy shadow stacks may lead to unexpected behavior. 

CLRSSBSY		Clear busy bit in a supervisor shadow stack token. 

INCSSP			Increment the shaow stack pointer (SSP)

RDSSP			Read shaow stack point (SSP)

RSTORSSP 		Restore a shadow stack pointer (SSP)

SAVEPREVSSP		Save previous shadow stack pointer (SSP)

SETSSBSY		Set busy bit in a supervisor shadow stack token 

WRSS 			Write to a shadow stack 

WRUSS			Write to a user mode shaow stack
