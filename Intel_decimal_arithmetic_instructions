Decimal arithmetic can be performed by combining the binary arithmetic instructions ADD, SUN, MUL, and DIV with the decimal arithmetic instructions. 
The decimal arithmetic instructions are provided to carry out the following operations: 

1) To adjust the results of a previous binary arithmetic operation to produce a valid BCD result. 

2) To adjust the operands of a subsequent binary arithmetic operation so that the operation will produce a valid BCD result 

These instructions operate on both packed and unpacked BCD values. 
THe decimal arithmetic instructions are divided into subordinate subgroups of instructions that provide: 
1) packed BCX adjustments 

2) unpacked BCD adjustments
