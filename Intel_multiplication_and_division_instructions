The processor provides two multiply intructions, MUL (unsinged multiply) and IMUL (singed multiply), and two divide instructions, DIV (unsigned divide (this is taxing on cpu)) and IDIV (sign divide).

The MUL instruction multiplies two unsigned integer operands. 
The result is computed to twice the size of the source operands 

The IMUL instruction multiplies two signed integer operands. 
The result is computed to twice the size of the source operands; however, in some cases the result is truncated to the size of the source operands.

The DIV instruction divides one unsigned operand by another unsigned operand and returns a quotient and a remainder

The IDIV instruction is identical to the DIV instruction, except that IDIV performs a signed divison.
