The behavior of MOVS (Move String), CMPS (compare string), SCAS (scan string), LODS (Load string), and STOS (store string) instructions in 64-bit mode is similar to their behavor in non-64-bit modes, with the following differences: 

1) The source operand is specified by RSI or DS:ESI, depending on the address size attribute of the operation 

2) The destination operand is specified by RDI or DS:EDI, depending on the address size attribute of the operation 

3) Operation on 64-bit data is supported by using the REX.W prefix

When using REP prefixes for string operations in 64-nit mode, the reapet count is specified by RCX or ECX
