The type conversion instructions convert bytes into words, words into doublewords, and doublewords into quadwords. 
These instructions are especially useful for converting integers to larger integer formats, because they perform sign etension

Two kinds of type conversion instructions are provided: 

1) Simple conversion -- The CBW (convert byte to word), CWDE (convert word to doubleword extended), CWD (convert word to doubleword), and CDQ (convert doubleword to quadword ) instructions perform sign extension to double the size of the source operand. The CBW instruction copies the sign (bit 7) of the byte in the AL register into every bit position of the upper byte of the AX register. The CWDE instruction copies the sign (bit 15) of the word in the AX register into every bit position of the high word of the EAX register. CWD instruction copies the sign (bit 15) of the word in the AX register into every bit position in the DX register. The CDQ instruction copies the sign (bit 31) of the doubleword in the EAX register into every bit position in the EDX register. The CWD instruction can be used to produce a doubleword dividend from a word before a word division, and the CDQ instruction can be used to produce a quadword dividend from a doubleword before doubleword dividsion. 

2) Move with sign or zero extension --  The MOVSX (move with sign extension) and MOVZX (move with zero extension) instructions move the source operand into a register then perform the sign extension. The MOVSX instruction extends an 8-bit value to a 16-bit value or an 8-bit or 16-bit value to a 32-bit value by sign extending the source operand. The MOVZX instruction extends an 8-bity value to a 16-bit value or an 8-bit value to a 32-bit valute by zero extending the source operand
