The ADD (add integers), ADC (add integers with carry), SUB (subtract integers), and SBB (subtract integers with borrow) instructions perfrom addtion and subtraction operations on signed or unsigned integers operands. 

The ADD instruction computes the sum of two integer operands. 

The ADC instruction computes the sum of two integer operands, plus 1 if the CF flag is set. 
This instruction is used to propagte a carry when adding numbers in stages. 

The SUB instruction computes the difference of two integetr operands 

THe SBB instructioin computes the deffernece of two integer operands, minus 1 if the CF flag is set. 
This instruction is used to propagate the borrow when subtracting numbers in stages
