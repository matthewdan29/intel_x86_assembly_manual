PHADDSW		Adds two adjacent, signed 16-bit integers horizontally from the source and destination operands and packs the signed, saturated 16-bit results to the destination operand.

PHSUBW		Performs horizontal subtraction on each adjacent pair of 16-bit signed integers by subtracting the most significant word fromt the least signeificant word of each pair in the source and destination oprand. The signed 16-bit results are packed and written to the destination operand. PHSUBW _m64 _mm_hsub_pi16(_m64 a, _m64 b); PHSUBD _m64 _mm_hsub_pi32(_m64 a, _m64 b); PHSUBW _m128i _mm_hsub_epi16(_m128i a, _m128i b); PHSUBD _m128i _mm_hsub_epi32(_m128i a, _m128ib); VPHSUBW _m256i _mm256_hsub_epi16(_m256i a, _m256i b); VPHSUBD _m256_hsub_epi32(_m356i a, _m256ib); 


PHSUBSW		Performs horizontal subtraction on each adjacent pair of 16-bit signed integers by subtracting the most significant word from the least significant word of each pair in the source and destination operands.
