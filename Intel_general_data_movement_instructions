Move instructions -- The MOV (move) and CMOVcc (conditional move) instructions transfer data between memory and registers or between registers. 


The MOV instruction performs basic load data and store data operations between memory and the processor's registers and data movement operations between registers. 

The MOV instructions cannot move data from one memory location to another or from one segment register to another segment register. 
Memory-to-memory moves are performed with the MOVS (string move) instruction. 


Conditional move instructions -- The CMOVcc instructions are a group of instructions that check the state of the status flags in the EFLAGS register and perform a move operation if the flags are in a specified state. 
THese instrcutions can be used to move a 16-bit or 32-bit value from memory to a general-purpose register or from one general-purpose register to another. 
The flage state, being tested is specified with a condition code (cc) associated with the instruction. 
If the condition is not satisfied, a move is not performed and execution continues with the instruction following the CMOVcc instruction. 

CMOVcc instructions are useful for optimizing small IF constructions. 
They also help eliminate branching overhead for IF statement and the possiblilty of branch mispredictions by the processor.
