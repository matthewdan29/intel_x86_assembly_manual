The INT n, INTO, INT3, and BOUND instructions allow a program ro task to explicity call an interrupt or exception handler. 
The INT n instruction (opcode CD) uses a vector as an argument, which allows a program to call any interrupt handler. 

The INTO instruction (opcode CE) explicity calls the overflow exception (#OF) hander if the overflow flag (OF) in the EFLAGS register is set. 
The OF flag indicates overflow on arithmetic instructions, but it does not automatically raise an overflow exception. 
AN overflow exception can only be raised explicitly in either of the following ways: 

1) Execute the INTO instruction

2) Test the OF flag and execute the INT n instruction with an argument of 4 (the vector of the overflow exception) if the flag is set. 

The INT3 instruction (opcode CC) explicitly calls the breakpoint exception (#BP) handler. 
Simillarly, the INT1 instrution (opcode F1) explicitly calls the debug exception (#DB) handler. 

The BOUND instruction explicitly calls the BOUND-range exceeded exception (#BR) handeler if an operand is found to be not within predefined boundaries in memoory.
