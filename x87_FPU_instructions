The x87 FPU instructions are executed by the processor's x87 FPU. 
These instructions operate on floating-point, integer, and binary-coded decimal (BCD) operands.

FLD		Load floating-point value. 

FST		Store floating-point value

FSTP 		Store floating-point value and pop

FILD		Load integer 

FIST		Store integer

FISTP^1		Store integer and pop

FBLD		Load BCD

FBSTP 		Store BCD and pop

FXCH		Exchange registers 

FCMOVE		Floating-point conditional move if equal 

FCMOVNE		Floating-point conditional move if not equal 

FCMOVB		Floating-point conditional move if below 

FCMOVBE		Floating-point conditional move if below or equal 
	
FCMOVNB		Floating-point conditional move if not below 

FCMOVNBE	Floating-point conditional move if not below or equal 

FCMOVU		FLoating-point conditional move if unordered

FCMOVNU		FLoating-point conditional move if not unordered
