The STI (set interrupt flag) and CLI (clear interrupt flag) instrucions allow the interrupt IF flag in the EFLAGS register to be modified directly. 
The IF flag controls the servicing of hardware-generated interrupts (those received at the processor's INTR pin). 
If the IF flag is set, the processor services hardware interrupts; it the IF flag is clear, hardware interrupts are masked. 

The ability to execute these instructions depends on the operating mode of the processor and the current priviliege level (CPL) of the program or task attempting to execute these instrutions.
