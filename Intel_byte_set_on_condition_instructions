The SETcc (set byte on condition) instructions set a destination-operand byte to 0 or 1, depending on the state of selected status flags (CF, OF, SF, ZF, and PF) in the EFLAGS register. 
The suffix (cc) added to the SET mnemonic determines the condition being tested for. 

For example, the SETO instruction tests for overflow. 
If the OF flag is set, the destination byte is set to 1; if OF is clear, the destination byte is cleared to 0.
