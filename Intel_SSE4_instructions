Intel Streaming SIMD extensions 4 (Intel SSE4) introduces 54 new instructions. 
Intel SSE4.1 is targeted to improve the performance of media, imaging, and 3D workloads. 
Intel SSE4.1 adds instructions that improve compiler vectorization and significantly increase support for packed dword computation. 
The technology also provides a hint that can improve memory throughtput when reading from uncacheable WC memory type. 
Intel 4.1 instructions include: 

1) Two instructions perform packed dword multiplies 

2) two intructions perform floating-point dot products with input/output selects. 

3) One instruction performs a load with a streaming hint. 

4) Six instructions simplify packed blending

5) Eight instructions expand support for packed integer MIN/MAX

6) Four instructions support floating-point round with selectable rounding mode and precision exveption override 

7) Seven instructions improve data insertion and extractions from XMM registers 

8) Twelve instructions improve packed integer format conversions (sign and zero extensions)

9) One instructions improves SAD (sum absolute difference) generation of small block sizes 

10) One instruction aids horizontal searchgin operations 

11) One instruction imporves masked comparisons. 

12) One instruction adds qword packed equality comparisons 

13) One instructioon adds dwords packing with unsigned saturation 

The Intel SSE4.2 instructions operating on XMM register include: 

1) String and text processing that can take advantage of single-instruction multiple-data programing (SIMD programing)

2) A SIMD integer instruction that enhances the capability of the 128-bit integer SIMD capability of SSE4.1
