In 64-bit mode, address calculations that reference SS segments are treated as if the segment base is zero. 
Fields (base, limit, and attribute) in segment descriptor registers are ignored. 
SS DPL (Stack segment Descriptor Privilege Level) is modified such that it is alwasys equal to CPL (Current privilege level). 
This will be true even if it is the onlhy field in the SS descriptor that is modified. 

Register E(SP), E(IP) and E(BP) are promoted to 64-bits and are remaned RSP, RIP, and RBP respectively. 
Some forms of segment load instructions are invalid (LDS, POP ES, are some to talk about)

PUSH/POP instructions increment/decrement the stack using a 64-bit width. 
When the contents of a segment register is pushed onto 64-bit stack, the pointer is automatically aligned to 64 buits (as with a stack that has a 32 bit width).
