BNDCL		Check the address of a memory reference against a LowerBound 

BNDCU		Chcek the address of a memory reference against an UpperBound in 1's complement form

BNDCN		Check the address of a memery reference against an UpperBound not in 1's complement form 

BNDMOV		Copy or load from memory of the LowerBound and UpperBound to a register 

BNDMOV		Store to memory of the LowerBound and UpperBound from a register 

BNDLDX		Load bounds using address translation

BNDSTX		Store bounds using address translation
