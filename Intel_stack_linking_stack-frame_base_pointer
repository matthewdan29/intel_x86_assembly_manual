The processor provides two pointers for linking of procedures: 
1) The stack-frame base pointer 

2) The return instruction pointer 

The Stack is typically divided into frames. 
Each stack frame can then contain local variables, parameters to be passed to another procedure, and procedure linking information. 
The stack-frame base pointer (contained in the EBP register) identifies a fixed reference point within the stack frame for the called procedure. 
To use the stack-frame base pointer, the called procedure typically copies the contents of the ESP register into the EBP register prior to pushhing any local variables on the stack. 
The stack-frame base pointer then permits easy access to data structures passed on the stack, to the return instruction pointer, and to local variables added to the stack by the called procedure. 

Like the ESP register, the EBP register automatically points to an address in the current stack segment (That is, the setment speicified by the current contents of the SS register)
