The FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions organize x87 state and SSE state in a region on memory called the "FXSAVE area". 
Each of the instructions takes a memory operand that specifies the 16-byte aligned based addres of the FXSAVE area on which it operates. 

Every FXSAVE area comprises the 512 bytes staring at the area's base address. 

The x87 state component compreses bytes 23:0 and bytes 159:32.
The SSE state component comprises bytes 31:24 and bytes 415:160. 
FXSAVE and FXRSTOR do not use bytes 511:416; bytes 463:416 are reserved.
