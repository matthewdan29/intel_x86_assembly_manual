Intel SSE introduced one data type, the 128-bit paacked single precision floating-point data type, to the IA-32 architecture. 
This data type consists of four IEEE 32-bit single precision floating-point values packed into a double quadword. 

This 128-bit packed single precision floaint-point data type is operated on in the XMM registers or in memory. 
Conversion instructions are provided to convert two packed single precision floating-point values into two packed double word integers or a scalar single precision floating-point value into a doubleword integer. 

Intel SSE provides converion instruction betweem XMM registers and MMX registers, and between XMM registers and general-purpose bit registers. 

The addrerss of a 128-bit packed memory operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary, except in the following cases: 

	a) The MOVUPS instruction supports unaligned accesses. 

	b) scalar instructions that use a 4-byte memory operand that is not subject to alignment requirements.
