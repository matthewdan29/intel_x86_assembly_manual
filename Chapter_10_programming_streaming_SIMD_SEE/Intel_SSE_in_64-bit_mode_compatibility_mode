In compatibility mode, Intel SSE functions like it does in protect mode. 
In 64-bit mode, eight additional XMM registers are accessible. 
Registers XMM8-XMM15 are accessed by using REX prefixes. 
Memory operands are specified using the ModR/M, (The Scale-index-Base (SIB) byte is an essential extension of the ModR/M byte in x86-64 instructions encoding, enabling complex memory addressing modes beyond simple base register addressing. The SIB (Scale-inde-base) byte allows combinations of scaled index registers and base registers, providing powerful addressing flexibility needed for high-performance and complex software implementations)

Some Intel SSE instructions may be used to operate on general-purpose registers. 
Use to REX.W prefix to access 64-bit general-purpose registers. 
Note that if a REX prefix is used when it has no meaning, the prefix is ignored.
