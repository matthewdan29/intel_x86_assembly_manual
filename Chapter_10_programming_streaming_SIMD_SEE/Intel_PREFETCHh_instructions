The PREFETCHh instructions permit programs to load data into the processor at a suggested cache level, so that the data is closer to the processor's load and store unit when it is needed. 
These instructions fetch 32 aligned bytes (or more, depending on the implementation) containing the addressed byte to a location in the cache hierarchy specified by the temproal locality hint. 
The hints specify a prefetch of either temproal or non-temporal data.
Subsequent accesses to temporal data are treated like normal accesses, while those to non-temporal data will continue to minimize cache pollution. 
If the data is already present at a level of the cache hierarchy that is closer to the processor, the PREFETCHh instruction will not result in any data movement. 
The PREFETCHh instructions do not affect functional behavior of the program.
