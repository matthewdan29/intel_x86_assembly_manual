The compare instructions compare packed and scalar single precision floating-point values and return the results of the comparison either to the destination operand or the EFLAGS register. 

The CMPPS (compare packed single precision floating-point values) instruction compares the corresponding values from two packed single precision floating-point operands, using an immediate operand as a predicate, and returns a 32-bit mask result of all 1s or all 0s for each comparison to the destination operand. 
The value of the immediate operand allows the selection of any of 8 compare condition: equal, less than, less than equal, unordered, not equal, not less than, not less than or equal, or ordered. 

The CMPSS (compare scalar single precision, floating-point values) instruction compares the low values from two packed single precision floating-point operands, using an immediate operand as a predicate, and returns a 32-bit mask result of all 1s or all 0s for the comparison to the low doubleword of the destination operand. 
The immediate operand selects the compare conditions as with the CMPPS instruction. 

The COMISS (compare scalar single precision floating-point values and set EFLAGS) and UCOMISS(unordered compare scalar single precision floating-point values and set EFLAGS) instructions compare the low values of two packed single precision floating-point operands and set the ZF, PF, and CF flags in the EFLAGS register to show the result (greater than, less than, equal or unorded). 
These two instructions differ as follows: the COMISS instrcution signals a floating-point invalid operation (#I) exception when a source operand is either a QNaN or an SNaN(SNaN is a signaling Not-a-Number value in floating-point math, used for exception handling);
