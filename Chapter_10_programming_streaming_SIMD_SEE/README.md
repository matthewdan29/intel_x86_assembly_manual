The Intel Streaming SIMD Extensions (Intel SSE) were introduced into the IA-32 architecture in the Pentium 3 processor family. 
These extensions enhance the performance of IA-32 processors for advance 2-D and 3-D graphics, motion video, image processing, speech recognition, audio synthesis, telephony, and video conferencing. 

Look at chapter 11 if you want to program is describes SSE which is more important to know before you get to chapter 11
