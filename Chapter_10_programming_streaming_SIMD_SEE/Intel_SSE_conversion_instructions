Intel SSE conversion instructions support packed and scalar conversions between single precision floating-point and doubleword integer formats. 

The CVTPI2PS (convert packed doubleword integers to packed single precision floating-point values) instruction converts two packed signed doubleword integers into two packed single precision floating-point values. 
When the conversion is inexact, the result is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register. 

The CVTSI2SS (convert signed integer to scalar single precision floating-point value) instruction converts a signed doubleword or quadword integer into a single precision floating-point value. 
When the conversion is inexact, the result is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register. 

The CVTPS2PI (convert packed single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction converts two packed single precision floating-point values into two packed signed doubleword integers. 
When the conversion is inexact, the resutl is rounded accroding to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register. 
The CVTTPS2PI (convert with truncation packed single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers) instruction is similar to the CVTPS2PI instruction, except that truncation is used to round a source value to an integer value. 

The CVTSS2SI (convert scalar single precision floating-point value to signed integer) instruction converts a single precision floating-point value into a signed integer. 
When the conversion is inexact, the result is rounded according to the rounding mode selected in the MXCSR register. 
The CVTTSS2SI (convert with truncation scalar single precision floating-point value to signed integer) instruction is simialr to the CVTSS2SI instruction, except the trumcation is used to round the source value to an integer value.
