The 32-bit MXCSR register contains control and staus information for Intel SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 SIMD floating-point operations. 
This register contains: 

	A) Flag and mask bits for SIMD flaoting-point exceptions. 

	B) Rounding control field for SIMD floating-point operations. 

	C) Flush-to-zero flag that provides a means of controlling underflow conditions on SIMD floating-point operations

	D) Denormals-are-zeros flag that controls how SIMD floating-point instructions handle denormal source operands. 

The contents of this register can be loaded form memory with the LDMXCSR and FXRSTOR instructions and stored in memory with STMXCSR and FXSAVE. 

Bits 16 through 31 of the MXCSR register are reserved and are cleared on a power-up or reset of the processor; attempting to write a non-zero value to these bits, using either the FXRSTOR or LDMXCSR instructions, will result in a general-protection exception (#GP) being generated.
