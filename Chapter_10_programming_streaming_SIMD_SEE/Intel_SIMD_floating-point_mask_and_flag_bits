Bits 0 through 5 of the MXCSR register indicate whether a SIMD floating-point exception has been detected. 
They are "sticky" flags. 
This is, after a flag is set, it remains set until explicitly cleared. 
To clear these flags, use the LDMXCSR or the FXRSTOR instructions to write zeroes to them. 

Bit 7 through 12 provide individual mask bits for the SIMD floating-point exceptions. 
An exception type is masked if the corresponding mask bit is set, and it is unmased if the bit is clear. 
These mask bits are set upon a power-up or reset. 
This causes all SIMD floating-point exceptions to be initially masked. 

If LDMXCSR or FXRSTOR clears a mask bit and sets the corresponding dexcption flag bit, a SIMD floating-point exception will not be generated as a result of this change. 
The unmasked exception will be generated only upon the execution of the next SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instruction that detects the unmasked exception condition.
