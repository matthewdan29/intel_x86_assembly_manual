The SFENCE (Store Fence) instruction controls write ordering by creating a fence for memory store operations. 
This instruction guarantees that the result of every store instruction that precedes the store fence in program order is globally visible before any store instruction that follows the fence. 
The SFENCE instruction provides an efficient way of ensuring ordering between procdures that produce weakly-ordered data and procedures that consume that data.
