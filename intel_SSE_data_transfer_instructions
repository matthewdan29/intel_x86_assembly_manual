Intel SSE data transfer instructions move packed and scalar single precision floating-poijnt operands between XMM registers and between XMM registers and memory

MOVAPS		Move four aligned packed single precision floating-point values between XMM registers or between an XMM register and memory

MOVUPS		Move four unaligned packed single precision floating-point values between XMM registers or between an XMM register and memory 

MOVHPS		Move two packed single precision floating-point values to and from the high quadword of an XMM register and memory 

MOVHPLS		Move two packed single precision floating-point values from the high quadword of an XMM register to the low quadword of another XMM register 

MOVLPS		Move two packed single precision floating-point values to and from the low quadword of an XMM register and memory 

MOVLHPS		Move two packed single precision flaoting-point values from the low quadword of an XMM register to the high quadword of another XMM register

MOVMSKPS	Extract sign mask from four packed single precision floating-point values 

MOVSS		Move scalar single precision floating-point value between XMM registers or between an XMM register and memory
