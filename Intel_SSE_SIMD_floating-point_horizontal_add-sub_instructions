HADDPS		Performs a single precision addtion on contiguous data elements. The first data element of the result is obtained by adding the first and second elements of the first operand; the second element by adding the third and fourth elements of the first operand; the third by adding the first and second elements of the second operand; and the fourth by adding the third and fourth elements of the second operand. HADDPS_m128_mm_hadd_ps(_m128 a, _m128 b); VHADDPS _m256_mm256_hadd_ps (_m256 a, _m256 b); 

HSUBPS		Performs a single precicion subtraction on contiguous data elements. The first data element of the result is obtained by subtracting the second element of the first operand from the first element of the first operand; the second element by subtracting the fourth element of the first operand from the third element of the first operand; the third by subtracting the second element of the second operand from the first element of the second operand; and the fourth by subtracting the fourth element of the second operand from the third element of the second operand. HSUBPS 	_m128_mm_hsub _ps(_m128 a, _128 b); VHSUBPS _m256 _mm256_hsub_ps(m256 a, m256 b);


HADDPD		Performs a double precision addtion on contiguous data elements. The first data element of the result is obtained by adding the first and second elements of the first operand; the second element by adding the first and second elements of the second operand (think of streaming vidoes on youtube). VHADDPD _m256d _mm256_hadd_pd(_m256 a, _m256d b); HADDPD _m128d _mm_hadd_pd(_m128d a, _m128d b); 


HSUBPD		Performs a double precision subtraction on contiguous data elements. The first data element of the result is obtained by subtracting the second element of the first operand from the first element of the first operand; the second element by subtracting the second element of the second operand from the first element of the second operand.  HSUBPD _m128d _mm_hsub_pd(_m128d a, _m128d b); VHSUBPD _m256d _mm256_hsub_pd(_m256d a, _m256d b);
