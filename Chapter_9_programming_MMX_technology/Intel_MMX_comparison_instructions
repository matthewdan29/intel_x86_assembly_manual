The PCMPEQB/PCMPEQW/PCMPEQD (compare packed data for equal) instructions and the PCMPGTB/PCMPGTW/PCMPGTD (compare packed signed integers for greater than) instructions compare the corresponding signed data elements (bytes, word or doublewords) in the source and destination operands for equal to greater than, repsectively. 

These instructions generate a mask of ones or zeros which are written to the destination operand. 
Logical operations can use the mask to select packed elements. 
This can be used to implement a packed conditional move operation without a branch or a set of branch instructions. 
No flags in the EFLAGS register are affected.
