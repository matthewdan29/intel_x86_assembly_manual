MMX technology defines a simple and flexible SIMD(single instruction multi data) execution model to handle 64-bit packed integer data. 
This model adds the following features to the IA-32 architecture, while maintaining backwards compatibility with all IA-32 applications and operating-system code: 

	1) Eight new 64-bit data registers, called MMX registers. 

	2) Three new packed data types: 

		2a) 64-bit packed byte integers (signed and unsigned)

		2b) 64-bit word integers (signed and unsigned)

		2c) 64-bit packed doubleword integers (signed and unsigned)

	3) instructions that support the new data types and to handle MMX state management

	4) Extensions to the CPUID instruction

MMX technology is accessible from all the IA-32-architecture execution modes. 
It does not add any new modes to the architecture.
