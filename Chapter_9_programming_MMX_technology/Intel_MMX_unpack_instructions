The PUNPCKHBW/PUNPCKHWD/PUNPCKHDQ (unpack high-order data elements) instructions and the PUNPCKLBW/PUNPCKLWD/PUNPCKLDQ (unpack low-order data elements) instructions unpack bytes, words, or doublewords from the high- or low-order data elements of the source and destination operands and interleave them in the destination operand. 
By placing all 0s in the source operand, these instructions can be used to convert byte integers to words integers, word integers to doubleword intgers, or doubleword integers to quadword integers.
