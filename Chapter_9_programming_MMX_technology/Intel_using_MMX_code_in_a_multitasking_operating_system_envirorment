An application needs to identify the nature of the multitasking operating system on which it runs. 
Each task retains its own stat which must be saved when a task switch occurs. 
The processor state (context) consists of the general-purpose registers and the floating-point and MMX registers. 

Operating systems can be classified into tow types: 

	1) Cooperative multitaking OS (Windows or linux)

	2) Preemptive multitasking OS (Windows, linux, or Mac)

Cooperative multitasking OS do not save the FPU or MMX state when performing a context switch.
Therefore, the application needs to save the relevant state befrooe relinquishing direct or indirect control to the OS. 

Preemptive multitasking OS systems are responsible for saving and restoring the FPU and MMX state when performing a context switch. 
Therefor, the application does not have to save or restore the FPU and MMX state.
