Applications can contain both x87 FPU floating-point and MMX instructions. 
However, because the MMX registers are aliased to the x87 FPU register stack, care must be taken when making transitions between x87 FPU instructions and MMX instructions to prevent incoherent or undexpected results. 

When an MMX instruction (other than the MMS instruction) is executed, the processor changes the x87 FPU state as follows: 
		1) The TOS (top of stack) value of the x87 FPU status word is set to 0. 

		2) the entire x87 FPU tag word is set to the valid state (00B in all tag fields)

		3) When an MMX instruction writes to an MMX register, it writes ones (11B) to the exponent part of the corresponding floating-point register (bits 64 through 79). 

The net result of these actions is that any x87 FPU state prior to the execution of the MMX instruction is essentially lost. 

When an x87 FPU instruction is executed, the processor assumes that the current state of the x87 FPU register stack and control registers is valid and executes the instructions without any preparatory modifications to the x87 FPU state. 

If the application contains both x87 FPU floating-point and MMX instructions, the following guidelines are recommended: 

		A) When transitioning between x87 FPU and MMX code, save the state of any x87 FPU data or control registers that need to be preserved for future use. THe FSAVE and FXSAVE instructions save the entire x87 FPU state. 

		B) When transitioning between MMX and x87 FPU code, do the following: 

			1) save any data in the MMX registers that needs to be preserved for future use. FSAVE and FXSAVE also save the state of MMX registers. 

			2) Execute the EMMS instruction to clear the MMX state from the x87 data and control registers
