When stored in memory: bytes, words, and doublewords in the packed data types are stored in consective addresses. 
The least significant byte, word, or doubleword is stored at the lowest address and the most significant byte, word, or doubleword is stored at the high address. 
The ordering of bytes, words, or doublewords in memory is always little endian. 
This is, the bytes with the low addresses are less significant than the bytes with high addresses.
