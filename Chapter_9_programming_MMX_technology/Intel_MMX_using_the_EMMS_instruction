When an MMX instruction executes, the x87 FPU tag word is marked valid (00B). 
In this state, the execution of subsequent x87 FPU instructions may produce unexpected x87 FPU floating-point exceptions and/or incorrect results because the x87 FPU register stack appears to contain valid data. 
The EMMS instruction is provided to prevent this problem by marking the x87 FPU tag word as empty. 

The EMMS instruction should be used in each of the following cases: 

	A) When an application using the x87 FPU instructions calls an MMX technology library/DLL (use the EMMS instruction at the end of the MMX code).

	B) When an application using MMX instructions calls a x87 FPU floating-point library/DLL (use the EMMS instruction before calling the x87 FPU code). 

	C) When a switch is made between MMX code in a task or thread and other tasks or threads in cooperative operating systems, unless it is certain that more MMX instructions will be executed before any x87 FPU code. 

EMMS is not required when mixing MMX technology instructions with Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3 instructions
