MMX technology enables direct access to all the MMX registers. 
This means the all existing interface convertions that apply to the use of the processor's general-purpose registers (EAX, EBX, etc) also apply to the use of MMX registers.

An efficient interface to MMX routines might pass parameters and return values throught the MMX registers or throught a combination of memory locations (via the stack) and MMX registers. 
Do not use the EEMS instruction or mix MMX and x87 FPU code when using the MMX registers to pass parameters. 

If a high-level language that does not support the MMX data types directly is used, the MMX data types can be defined as 64-bit structure containing packed data types. 

When implementing MMX instructions in high-level languages, other approaches can be taken, such as: 

	1) Passing parameters to an MMX routine by passing a pointer to a structure via the stack. 

	2) Returning a value from a function by returning a pointer to a structure
