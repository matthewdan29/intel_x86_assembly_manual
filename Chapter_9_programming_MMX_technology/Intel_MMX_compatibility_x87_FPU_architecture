The MMX state is aliased to the x87 FPU state. 
No new states or modes have been added to IA-32 architecture to support the MMX technology. 
The same floating-point instructions that save and restore the x87 FPU state also handle the MMX state (for example, during context switching).

MMX technology uses the same interface techniques between the x87 FPU and the operating system (primarily for task switching purposes).
