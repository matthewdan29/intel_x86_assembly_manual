MMX instructions generate the same type of memory-access exceptions as other IA-32 instructions. 

Exiting exceptions handlers do not have to be modified to handle these types of exceptions for MMX code. 

Unless there is a pending floating-point exception, MMX instructions do not generate numeric exceptions. 
Therfore, there is no need to modify existing exceptions handlers or add new ones to handle numeric exceptions. 

If a floating-point exception is pending, the subsequent MMX instruction generates a numeric error exception. The MMX instruction resumes exeception upon return from the exception hanlder.
