SSE3 provde 32 instructions to accelerate computations on packed integers. 
These include: 

1) Tweleve instructions that perform horizontal addition or subtraction operations. 

2) Six instructions that evaluate absolute values 

3) two instructions that perform multiply and add operations and speed up the evaluation of dot products 

4) Two instructions that accelerate packed-integer multiply operations and produce integer values with scaling 

5) two instructions that perform a byte-wise, in-place shuffle according to the second shuffle control operand 

6) siz instructions that negate packed integers in the destinations operand if the signs of the corresponding elelment in the source operand is less than zero. 

7) Two instructions that align data from the composite of two operands
