Intel AVX-512 instructions provide a wide range of functionality that support programming in 512-bit, 256 and 128-bit vector register, plus support for opmask registers and instructions operating on opmask registers. 
The collecetion of 512-bit SIMD instruction sets in Intel AVX-512 include new functionality not available in Intel AVX and Intel AVX2, and promoted instructions similar to equivalent ones in Intel AVX/intel AXX2 but with enhancedment provided by opmask registers not available to VEX-encoded intel AVX/Intel AVX2. 
Some Instruction mnemoics that are available only with EVEX encoding, VBRODCASTF128 into VBROADCASTF32X4
An Intel AVX-512 instruction set architecture for FP16 was added, supporteing a wide range of general-purpose numeric operations for 16-bit half precision floating-point values, which complements the existing 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point instructions already available in the Intel Xeon processor-based products.
