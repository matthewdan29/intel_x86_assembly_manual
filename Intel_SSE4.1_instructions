Intel SSE4.1 instructions can use an XMM register as a source or destination. 
Programming Intel SSE4.1 is similar to programming 128-bit integer SIMD and floating-point SIMD instruction in Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE3.
Intel SSE4.1 does not provide any 64-bit integer SIMD instructions operating on MMX registers.
