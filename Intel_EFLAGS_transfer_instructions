The EFLAGS transfer instructions allow groups of flags in the EFLAGS register to be copied to a register or memory or be loaded from a register or memory. 

The LAHF (load AH from flags) and SAHF (store AH into flags) instructions operate on five of the EFLAGS status flags (SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF). 
The LAHF instruction copies the status flags to bits 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 of the AH register, respectively. 
The contents of the remaining bits in the register (bits 5, 3, and 1) are unaffected, and the contens of the EFLAGS register remain unchanged. 
The SAHF instrucions copies bits 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 from the AH register into the SF, ZF, AF, PF, and CF flags, repectively in the EFLAGS register. 

The PUSHF (push flags), PUSHFD (push flags double), POPF (pop flags), and POPFD (pop flags double) instructions copy the flags in the EFLAGS register to and from the stack. 
The PUSHF instrucion pushes the lower word of the EFLAGS register onto the stack. 
The PUSHFD instruction pushes the entire EFLAGS register onto the stack (with the RF and VM flags read as clear). 

The POPF instruction pops a word from the stack into the EFLAGS register. 
Only nits 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 4, 2, and 0 of the EFLAGS register are affected with all uses of this instruction. 
If the current privilege level (CPL) of the current code segment is 0 (most privilege ), the IOPL bits (bits 13 and 12) also are affected. 
If the I/O privilege level (IOPL) is greater than or equal to the CPL , numerically, the IF flag (bit 9) also is affected. 

The POPFD instrucion pops a double word into the EFLAGS register. 
THis instruction can change the state of the AC bit (bit 18) and the ID bit (bit 21), as well as the bits affected by a POPF instrucion. 
The restrictions for changing the IOPL bits and the IF flag that were given for the POPF instruction also apply to the POPFD instruction.
