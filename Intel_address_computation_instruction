The LEA (load effective address) instruction computes the effective address in memory (offset within a segment) of a source operand and places it in a general-purpose register. 
This instruction can interpret any of the processor's addressing modes and can perform any indexing or scaling that may be needed. 
It is especially useful for initializing the ESI or EDI registers before the execution of string instructions or for initializing the EBX register befor an XLAT instruction
