The pointer for a stack segment should be aligned on 16-bit (word) or 32-bit (double-word) boundaries, depending on the width of the stack segment. 
The D flag in the segment descriptor for the current code segment sets the stack-segment width.
THe PUSH and POP instrcutions use the D flag to determine how much to decrement or increment the stack pointer on a push or pop operation, respectively. 
When the stack width is 16-bits, the stack pointer is incremented or decremenented in 16-bit increamnts; when the width is 32 bits, the stack pointer is incremented or decremented in 32-bit increments. 
Pushing a 16-bit value onto a 32-bit wide stack can result in stack misaligned. 
One exception to this rule is when the contents of segment register are pushed onto a 32-bit wide stack. 
Here the processor automatically aligns the stack pointer to the next 32-bit boundary.
The processsor does not check stack pointer alignment. 
It is the responsibilty of the programs, tasks, and system procedures running on the processor to maintain proper alighment of stack pointers. 
Misaligning a stack pointer can cause serious performance degradation and in some instances program failures
