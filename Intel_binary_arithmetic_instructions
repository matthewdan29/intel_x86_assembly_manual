Binary arithmetic instructions operate on 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit numeric data encoded as signed or unsigned binary integers. 
The binary arithmetic instructions may also be used in algorithms that operate on decimal (BCD) values. 

The sub groups are: 
1) Add and subtract 
2) increment and decrement 
3) compare and change signs
4) multiply and divide
