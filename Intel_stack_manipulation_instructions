The PUSH, POP, PUSHA (push all register), and POPA (Pop all registers) instructions move data to and from the stack. 
The PUSH instruction decrements the stack pointer (contained in the ESP register), then copies the source operand to the top of stack. 
It operates on memory operands, immediate operands, and register operands (including segment registers). 
The PUSH instruction is commonly used to place parameters on the stack before calling a procedure. 
It can also be used to reserve space on the stack for temporary variables. 

The PUSHA instruction saves the contents of the eight general-purpose registers on the stack. 
This instruction simplifies procedure calls by reducing the number of instructions requiired to save the contents of the general-purpose registers. 
The registers are pushed on the stack in the following order: 
1) EAX
2) ECX
3) EDX
4) EBX

the initial value of ESP before EAX was pushed, EBP, ESI, and EDI

The POP instruction copies the word or doubleword at the current top of stack (indicated by the ESP register) to the location specified with the destination operand. 
It then increments the ESP register to point to the new top of stack. 
The destination operand may specify a general-purpose register, a segment register, or a memory location. 

The POPA instruction reverses the effect of the PUSHA instruction. 
It pops the top eight words or doublewords from the top of the stack into the general-purpose registers, except for the ESP register. 
If the operandsize attribute is 32, the doublewords on the stack are transferred to the registers in the following order: 
1) EDI
2) ESI
3) EBP
4) ignore doubleword, 
5) EBX
6) EDX
7) ECX
8) EAX

The ESP register is retored by the action of popping the stack. 
If the operand-size attribute is 16, the words on the stack are transferred to the registers in the following order: 
1) DI
2) SI
3) BP
4) ignore word
5) BX
6) DX
7) CX
8) AX
