Instructions that use the stack impliicitly (PUSH and POP instrctions) have two address-size attributes each of either 216 or 32 bits. 
This is because they always have the implicit address of the top of the stack, and they may also have an explicit memory address (PUSH Array[EBX]). 
The attribute of the explicit address is determined by the D flag of the current code segment and the presence or absence of the 67H address-size prefix. 

The address-size attribute of the top of the stack determines whether SP or ESP is used for the stack access. 
Stack operations with an address-size attribute of 16 use the 16-bit SP stack pointer register and can use a maximum stack address of FFFFH; stack operations with an address-size attribute of 32 bits use the 32-bit ESP register and can use a maximum address of FFFFFFFH. 
The default address-size attribute for data segments used as stacks is controlled by the B flag of the segment's descriptor. 
When this flag is clear, the default address-size attribute is 16 bit; when the flag is set, the address-size attribute is 32.
