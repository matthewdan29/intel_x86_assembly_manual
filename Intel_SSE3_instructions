The intel SSE3 extensions offers 13 instructions that accelerate performance of streaming SIMD extendions technoloy, Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 technology, and x87-FP math capabilites. 
These instructions can be grouped into the following categories: 

1) One x87 FPU instructions used in integer conversino 

2) One SIMD integer instruction that addresses unaligned data loads 

3) Two SIMD floating-point packed ADD/SUB instructions 

4) Four SIMD floating-point horizontal ADD/SUB instructions 

5) Three SIMD floating-point LOAD/MOVE/DUPLICATE instructions (The duplicate is more important to me)

6) Two thread synchronization instructions
