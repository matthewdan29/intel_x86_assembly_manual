The RDSEED instruction returns a random number. 
All Intel processorss that support the RDSEED instruction indicate the availability of the RDSEED instruction via reporting CPUID.(ECX=07H, ECX=0H):EBX.RDSEED[bit 18] = 1.
RDSEED returns random numbers that are supplied by a cryptographically secure, enhanced non-deterministic random bit generator (Enhanced NRBG). 
The NRBG is desgned to meet the NIST SP 800-90B and NIST SP800-90C

Under heavy load, with multiple cores executing RDSEED in parallel, it is possible for the demand of random numbers by software processes/threads to exceed the rate at which the random number generator hardware can supply them. 
This will lead to the RDSEED instruction returning no data transitorily. 
The RDSEED instruction indicates the occurrence of this situation by clearing the CF flag. 

The RDSEED instrcution returns with the carry flag set (CF = 1) to indicate valid data is returned. 
It is recommended that software using the RDSEED instruction to get random number retry foor a limited number of iterations while RDSEED returns CF=0 and complete when valid data is returned, indicated with CF=1. 
This will deal with transitory underflows. 
A retyr limit should be employed to prevent a hard failure in the NRBG (expected to be extremely rare) leading to a busy loop in software. 

The intrinsic primitive for RDSEED is defined to address software's need for the common cases (CF =1) and the rare situations (CF = 0). 
The intrinsic primitive returns a value that reflects the value of the carry flag returned by the underlying RDEED instruction.
