Intel SSE instruction represent and extension of the SIMD execution model introfuced with the MMX technology. 
Intell SSE instructions can only be executed on Intel 64 and IA-32 processors that support Intel SSE extensions.
Intel SSE instruction can only be executed on Intel 64 and IA-32 processors that support Intel SSE extensions. 
Support for these instructions can be detected with the CPUID instruction. 

Intel SSE instructions are divided into for subgroups 

1) SIMD single precision floating-point instructions that operate on the XMM registers 

2) MXCSR state managment instructions 

3) 64-bit SIMD integer instructions that operate on the MMX registers 

4) Cacheability control, prefetch, and instruction ordering instructions
