Intel SSE2 data movement instructions move double precision floating-point data between XMM registers and between XMM regsiters and memory. (this stuff should start looking like english to everyone on the detail of the "functions")

MOVAPD		Move two aligned packed double precision floating-point values between XMM registers or between an XMM register and memory 

MOVUPD		Move two unaligned packed double precision floating-point values between XMM registers or between an XMM register and memory 

MOVHPD		Move high packed double precision floating-point value to and from the high quadword of an XMM register and memory 

MOVLPD		Move low packed single precision floating-point value to and from the low quadword of an XMM register and memory

MOVMSKPD	Extract sign mask from two packed double precision floating-point values 

MOVSD		Move scalar double precision floating-point value between XMM registers and between an XMM register and memory.
