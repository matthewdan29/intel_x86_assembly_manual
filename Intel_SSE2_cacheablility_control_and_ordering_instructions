Intel SSE2 cacheability control instructions provide additional operations for caching of non-temporal data when storing data from XMM registers to memory. 
LFENCE and MFENCE provide additional control of instruction ordering on store operations 

CLFUSH		Flushes and invalidates a memory operand and its associated cache line from all levels of the processor's cache hierarchy

LFENCE		Serializes load operations 

MFENCE		Serializes load and store operations 

PAUSE 		Improves the performance of "spin-wait loops"

MASKMOVDQ	Non-temporal store of selected bytes from an XMM register into memory 

MOVNTPD		Non-temporal store of two packed double precision floating-point values from and XMM register into memory 

MOVNTDQ		Non-temporal store of double quadword from an XMM register into memory 

MOVNTI		Non-temporal store of a doubleword from a general-purpose register into memory
