For each x87 FPU data type, one unique encoding is reserved for representing the special value "indefinite" (refers to a specific, reserved encoding used in intel processor (specifically the x87 FPU and SSE/AVX) to represent a special indefinite value in floating-point and integer data types. This value is typically produced as a result of masked floating-point invalid-operation exceptions, indicating an undefined or unrepresentable result from a calculation).
The x87 FPU produces indefinite values as respoinses to some masked floating-point invalid-operation exceptiojns. 
QNaN floating-point indefinite, and packed BCD integer indefinite, respectively. 

The binary integer encoding 100...00B represents either of two things, depending on the circumstances of its use: 

1) The largest negative number supported by the format (-2^15, -2^31, or -2^63). 

2) The integer indefinite value

If this encoding is used as a source operand (as in an integer load or integer arithmetic instruction), the x87 FPU interprets it as the largest negative number representable in the format being used. 
If the x87 FPU detects an invalid operation when storing an integer value in memory with an FIST/FISTP instruction and the invalid-operation exception is masked, the x87 FPU stores the integer indefinite encoding in the destination operand as a masked respoinse to the exception. 
In situations where the origin of a value with this encoding may be ambiguous, the invalid-operation exception flag can be examined to see if the value was produced as a response to an exception.
