The precision-control (PC) field (bits 8 and 9 of the x87 FPU control word) determines the precision (64, 53, or 24 bits) of floating-point calculations made by the x87 FPU. 
The default precision is double extended precision, which uses the full 64-bit significand available with the double extended precision floating-point format of the x87 FPU data registers. 
This setting is best suited for most applications, becuase it allows applications to take full advantage of the maximum precision available with the x87 FPU data registers. 

The double precision and single precision settings reduce the size of the significand to 53 bits and 24 bits, respectively. 
These settings are provided to support IEEE standard 754 and to provide compatibility with the specificantions of certain existing programming languages. 
Using these settings nullifies the advatages of the double extended precision floating-point format's 64-bit significant length. 
When reduced precision is specified, the rounding of the significand value clears the unused bits on the right to zeros. 

The precision-control bits only affect the results of the following floating-point instructions: FADD, FADDP, FIADD, FSUB, FSUBP, FISUB, FSUBR, FSUBRP, FISUBR, FMUL, FMULP, FIMIL, FDIV, FDIVP, FIDIV, FDIVR, FDIVRP, FIDIVR, and FSQRT
