Like the general-purpose registers, the contents of the x87 FPU data registers are unaffected by procedure calls, or in other words, the values are mmaintained across procedure boundaries. 
A calling procedure can thus use the x87 FPU data registers (as well as the procedure stack) for passing parameter between procedures. 
The called procedure can reference paramaters passed through the register stack using the current stack register pointer (TOP) and the ST(0) and ST(i) when returning execution to the calling procedure or program. 

When mixing MMX and X87 FPU instructions in the procedures or code sequences, the programmer is responsible for maintaining the integrity of parameters being passed in the x87 FPU data registers. 
If an MMX instruction is executed before the parameters in the x87 FPU data registers have been passed to another procedure, the parameters may be lost.
