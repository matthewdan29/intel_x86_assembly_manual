The x87 FPU supports two mechanisms for branching and performing conditional moves according to comparisons of two floating-point values. 
These mechanism are referred to here as the "old mechanism" and the "new mechanism". I will only explain the new you can read the old mechanism on page 210 in the Intel man pages. 

The new mechanism is available beginning with the P6 family processors. 
Using the mechanism, the new floating-point compare and set EFLAGS instructions (FCOMI, FCOMIP, FUCOMI, and FUCOMIP) compare two floating-point values and set the ZF, PF, and CF flags in the EFLAGS register directly. 
A single instruction thus replaces the three instructions required by the old mechanism. 

Note also that the FCMOVcc instructions (also new in the P6 family processors) allow conditional moves of floating-point values (values in the x87 FPU data registers) based on the setting of the status flags (ZF, PF, and CF) in the EFLAGS register. 
These instructions eliminate the need for an IF statement to perform conditional moves of floating-point values.
