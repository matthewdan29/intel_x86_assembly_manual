The x87 FPU stores in the 11-bit x87 FPU opcode register (FOP) the opcode of the last x87 non-control instruction executed that incurred an unmasked x87 exception. (This infromation provides state infromation for exeception handlers.)
Only the first and second opcode bytes (after all prefixes) are stored in the x87 FPU opcode register. 
Since the upper 5 bits of the first opcode byte are the same for all floating-point opcodes (11011B), only the lower 3 bits of this byte are tored in the opcode register.
