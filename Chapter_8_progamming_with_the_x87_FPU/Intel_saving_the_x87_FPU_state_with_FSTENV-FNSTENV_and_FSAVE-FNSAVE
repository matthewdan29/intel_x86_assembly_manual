The FSTENV/FNSTENV and FSAVE/FNSAVE instructions store the x87 FPU state information in memory for use by exception handlers and other system and application software. 
The STENVE/FNSTENV instruction saves the contents of the status, control, tag, x87 FPU instruction pointer, x87 FPU data pointer, and opcode registers. 
The FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction stores that information plus the contents of the x87 FPU data registers. 
Note that the FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction also initializes the x87 FPU to default values (just as the FINIT/FNINIT instruction does) after it has saved the original state fo the x87 FPU. 

The manner in which this information is stored in memory depends on the operating mode of the processor (protect mode or real-address mode) and on the operand-size attribute in effect (32-bit or 16-bit).


The FLDENV and FRSTOR instructions allow x87 FPU state infromation to be loaded from memory into the x87 FPU. 
Here, the FLDENV instruction loads only the status, control, tag, x87 FPU instruction pointer, x87 FPU data pointer, and opcode registers, and the FRSTOR instruction loads all the x87 FPU registers, including the x87 FPU stack registers.
