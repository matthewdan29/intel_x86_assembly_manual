The state of the x87 FPU can be saved with the FSTENV/FNSTENV or FSAVE/FNSAVE instructions. 

If the faulting floating-point instruction is followed by one or more non-floating-point instructions, it may not be useful to re-execute the faulting instruction. 

In cases where the handler needs to restart program execution with the faulting instruction, the IRET instruction cannot be used directly. 
The reason for this is that because the exception is not generated until the next floatin-point or WAIT/FWAIT instruction following the faulting floating-point instruction, the return instruction pointer on the stack may not point to the faulting instruction. 
To restart program execution at the faulting instruction, the exception handler must obtain a pointer to the instruction for the saved x87 FPU state information, load it into the return instruction pointer location on the stack, and then execute the IRET instruction.
