The FXSAVE and FXRSTOR instructions save and restore, respectively, the x87 FPU state along with the state of the XMM registers and the MXCSR register.
Using the FXSAVE instruction to save the x87 FPU state has two benefits: 

1) FXSAVE executes faster than FSAVE, 

2) FXSAVE saves the entire x87 FPU, MMX, and XMM state in one operation.
