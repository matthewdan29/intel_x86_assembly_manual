The following instructions control the state and modes of operation of the x87 FPU. 
They also allow the status of the x87 FPU to be examined: 

FINTI/FNINIT		Initialize x87 FPU

FLDCW			Load x87 FPU control word. 

FSTCW/FNSTCW		Store x87 FPU control word 

FSTSW/FNSTSW		Store x87 FPU status word 

FCLEX/FNCLED		Clear x87 FPU exception flags 

FLDENV			Load x87 FPU evnironment 

FSTENV/FNSTENV		Store x87 FPU environment 

FRSTOR			Restore x87 FPU state. 

FSAVE/FNSAVE		Save x87 FPU state. 

FINCSTP			Increment x87 FPU register stack pointer 

FDECSTP			Decrement x87 FPU register stack pointer

FFREE			Free x87 FPU register

FNOP			No operation (IDK why I'm putting this)

WAIT/FWAIT		Check for and handle pending unmasked x87 FPU exceptions 

The FINIT/FNINIT intructions initialize the x87 FPU and it internal registers to default values. 

The FLDCW instructions loads the x87 FPU control word register with a value from memory. 
The FSTCW/FNSTCW and FSTSW/FNSTSW instructions store the x87 FPU control and status words, repectively, in memory (or for an FSTSW/FNSTSW instruction in a general-purpose register).

The FSTENV/FNSTENV and FSAVE/FNSAVE instructions save the x87 FPU environment and state, respectively, in memory. 
The x87 FPU environment includes all the x87 FPU's control and status registers; the x87 FPU stat includes the x87 FPU environment and the data registers in the x87 FPU register stack.(The FSAVE/FNSAVE instruction also initializes the x87 FPU to default values, like the FINIT/FNINIT instruction, after it saves the original state of the x87 FPU). 

The FLDENV and FRSTOR instructions load the x87 FPU enviroment and state, repectively from memory into the x87 FPU. 
These instructions are commonly used when switching tasks or contexts. 

The WAIT/FWAIT instructions are synchronization instructions. (They are actually mnemonics for the same opcode. )
These instructions check the x87 FPU status word for pending unmasked x87 FPU exceptions. 
If any pending unmasked x87 FPU exceptions are fond, they are handled before the processor resumes excetions of the instructions (integer, floating-point, or system instruction) in the instruction stream. 
The WAIT/FWAIT instructions are provided to allow synchronization of instruction execution between the x87 FPU and the processor's integer unit.
