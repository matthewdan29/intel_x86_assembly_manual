When dealing with floating-point exceptions, it is useful to distinguish between "Arithmetic instructions" (Intel arithmetic instrucions include operation like addition(add), subtraction(sub), multiplicagtion(MUL, IMUL), and division(DIV, IDIV), along with comparison (CMP) and negation(NEG). These instructions perform calculations on data, using operands from registers or memory and updateing flags in the CPU based on the results.) and "Non-arithmetic instructions"(Intel's instructions can be categorized into groups such as data transfer, logical operations, control flow, string manipulation, and system instructions. These instructions manage data movement, program execution flow, and system state rather than perfroming basic arithmetic like addition or multiplication).
Non-arithmetic instructions have no operands or do not make substantial changes to their operands. 
Arithmetic instructions do make significant changes to their operands; in particular, they make changes that could result in floating-point exceptions being signaled. 
It should be noted that some non-arithmetic instructions can signal a floating-point stack (fault) exception, but this exception is not the result of an operation on an operand.
