The stack fault flag (bit 6 of the x87 FPU status word ) indicates that stack overflow or stack underflow has occured with data in the x87 FPU data register stack. 
The x87 FPU explicitly sets the SF flag when it detects a stack overflow or underflow condition, but it does not explicity clear the flag when it detects an invalid-arithmetic-operand condition.

When this flag is set, the condition code flag C1 indicates the nature of the fault:  overflow (C1 = 1) and underflow (C1 =0). 
The SF flag is a "sticky" flag, meaning that after it is set, the processor does not clear it until it is explicity instructied to do so
