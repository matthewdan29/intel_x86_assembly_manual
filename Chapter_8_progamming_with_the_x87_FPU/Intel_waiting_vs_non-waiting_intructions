All of the x87 FPU instructions except a few special control instructions perform a wait operation (similar to the WAIT/FWAIT instructions), to check for and handle pending unmasked x87 FPU floating-point exceptions, before they perform their primary operation (such as adding two floating-point numbers). 
These instructions are called "waiting" instructions. 
Some of the x87 FPU control instructions, such as FSTSW/FNSTSW, have both a waiting and a non-waiting version. 
The waiting version (with the "F") executes a wait operation before it performs its primary operation; wheres, the non-waiting version (with the "FN") ignores pending unmasked exceptions. 

Non-waiting instructions allow software to save the current x87 FPU state without first handling pending exceptions or to reset or reinitialize the x87 FPU without regard for pending exceptions

					NOTES 
When operating a Pentium or Intel486 processor in MS-DOS compatibility mode, it is possible (under unusual circumstances) for a non-waiting instruction to be interrupted prior to being executed to handle a pending x87 FPU exception. 
When operating a P6 family, Prentium 4, or Intel Xeon processor in MS-DOS compatibility mode, non-waiting instructions cannot be interrupted in this way
