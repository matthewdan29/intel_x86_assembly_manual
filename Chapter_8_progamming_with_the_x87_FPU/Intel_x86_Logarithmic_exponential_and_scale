The following instructions provide two different logarithmic functions, and exponential function and a scale function: 

FYL2X		Logarithm 

FYL2XP1		Logarithm epsilon

F2XM1		Exponential

FSCALE		Scale

The FYL2X and FYL2XP1 instructions perform two different base 2 logarithmic operations. 
The FYL2X instruction computes (y * log₂x). 
This operation permits the calculation of the log of any base using the following equation: 

	log(subscript b)x = (1/log₂x) 

The FYL2XP1 instruction compputes (y * log₂(x + 1)). 
This opertaion provides optimum accuracy for values of x that are close to 0. 

The F2XM1 instruction computes (2(superscritp)2 - 1). 
This instruction only operates on source values in the range -1.0 to +1.0.

The FSCALE instructioon multiplies the source operand by a power of 2
