The four condition code flags (C0 through c3) indicate the results of floating-point comparison and arithmetic operations. 
These condition code bits are used principally for conditional branching and for storage of information used in excepting handleing. 

The C1 condition code flag is used for a cariety of functions. When both the IE and SF flags in the x87 FPU status word are set, indicating a stack overflow or underflow excepting (#Is), the C1 flag distinguihes between overflow (C1 = 1) and underflow (C1 = 0). 
When the PE flag in the status word is set, indicating an inexact (rounded) result, the C1 flag is set to 1 if the last founding by the instruction was upward. 
The FXAM instruction sets C1 to the sign of the value being examined. 

The C2 condtion code flag is used by the FPREM and FPREM1 instructions to indicate an incomplete reduction (op partial remainde).
When a successful reduction has been completed, the C0, C3 and C1 condition code flags are set to the three least-significant bits of the quotient (Q2, Q1, and Q0, respectively)

The FPTAN, FSIN, FCOS, and FSINCOS instructions set the C2 flag to 1 to indicate that the source operand is beyond the allowable range of +- 2^63 and clear the C2 flag if the source operand is within the allowable range. 
Where the state of the condition code flags are listed as undefined do not rely on any specific value in these flags.
