The following instructions perform four common trigonmetric functions: 

FSIN		Sine

FCOS		Cosine. 

FSINCOS		Sine and Cosine. 

FPTAN		Tangent

FPATAN		Arctangent

These instructions operate on the top one or two registers of the x87 FPU register stack and they return thier results to the stack. 
The source operands for the FSIN, FCOS, FSINCOS, and FPTAN instructions musht be given in radians; the source operand for the FPATAN instruction is given in rectangular coordinate units. 

The FSINCOS instruction returns both the sine and the cosine of a source operand value. 
It operates faster than excuting the FSIN and FCOS instructions in succession. 

The FPATAN instruction computes the arctangent of ST(1) devided by ST(0), returning a result in radians. 
It is usefull for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
