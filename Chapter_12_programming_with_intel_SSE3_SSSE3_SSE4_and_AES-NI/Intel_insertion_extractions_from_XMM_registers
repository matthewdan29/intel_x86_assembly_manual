EXTRACTPS extracts a single precision floating-point value from any dword offset in an XMM register and stores the result to memory or a general-purpose register. 
INSERTPS inserts a single floating-point value from either a 32-bit memory location or from specified element in an XMM register to a selected element in the destination XMM register. 
In addition, INSERTPS allows the insertion of +0.0f into any destination elements using a mask.
