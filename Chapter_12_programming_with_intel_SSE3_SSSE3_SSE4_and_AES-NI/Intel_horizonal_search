Intel SSE4.1 adds PHMINPOSUW (PHMINPOSUW is a specialized x86 instruction that finds the minimum value and location of a 16-bit unsigned integer in an 8-element vector packed into a 128-bit register, and places it in another 128-bit register, and places it in another 128-bit register. write the shortest porgram, function, or snippet that implements this instruction *will use little-endian ordering*)(Determin the minimum unsigned word value in the source operand (second operand) and place the unsigned word in the low word (bits 0-15) of the destinaition operand (first operand). The word index of the min value is stored in bits 16-18 of the destination operand. The remaining upper bits of the destination are set to zero.) search instructions that finds the value and location of the min unsigned word from one 8 horizontally packed unsigned words. 

Rapid search is often a significant component of motion estimation. 
MPSADBW (*Multiple Packed Sum of Absolute Differences of Bytes* calculates packed word results of sum-absolute-difference (SAD) of unsigned bytes from two blocks of 32-bit dword elements, using two select fields in the immediate byte to select the offesets of the two blocks within the first source operand and the second operand. Packed SAD word results are calulated within each 128-bit lane. Each SAD word result in calculated between a stationary bloc_2 and a sliding block_1 at consecutive byte-granular position within the first source operand.) and PHMINPOSUW can be used togeather to improve video encode.
