MPSADBW uses a 4-byte wide field from a source operand; the offset of the 4-byte field within the 128-bit source operand is specified by two immediate control bits. 
MPSADBW produces eight 16-bit SAD results. 
Each 16-bit SAD result is formed from overlapping pairs of 4 bytes in the destination with the 4-byte field from the source operand. 
MPSADBW uses eleven consecutive bytes in the destination operand, its offset is specified by a control bit in the immediate byte (i.e., the offset can be from byte 0 or from byte 4).
