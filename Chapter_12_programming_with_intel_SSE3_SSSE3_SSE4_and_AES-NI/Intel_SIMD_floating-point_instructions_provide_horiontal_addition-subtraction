The HADDPS instructions perform a single precision addition on contiguous data elements. 
The first data element of the result is obtained by adding the first and second elements of the first operand; the secnod element by adding the third and fourth elements of the first operand. 


The HSUBPS instruction performs a single precision subtraction on contiguous data elements. 
the first data element of the result is obtained by subtracting the second element of the first operand from the first element of the first operand. 



The HADDPD instruction performs a double precision addition on contiguous data elements. 
The first data element of the result is obtained by adding the first and second elements of the first opernad. 

The HSUBPD instructiong performs a double precision subtraction on contiguous data elements. 
The first data element of the reuslt is obtained by subtracting the second element of the first operand from the first element of the first operand.
