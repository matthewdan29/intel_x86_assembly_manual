Blending conditionally copies a data element in a source operand to the same element in the destination. 

The variable blend instructions (BLENDVPS, BLENDVPD, PBLENDW) introduce the use of control bits stored in an implicit XMM register (XMM0). 
The most significant bit in each field (the sign bit, for 2's complement integer or floating-point) is used as a selector.
