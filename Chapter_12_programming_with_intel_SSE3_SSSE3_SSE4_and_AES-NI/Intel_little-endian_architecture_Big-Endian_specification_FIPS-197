FIPS 197 text convention is to write hex strings with the low-memory byte on the left and the high-memoory byte on the right. 
Intel's converstion is the reverse. 
It is similar to the difference between Big Endian and Little Endian notaions. 
A 128 bits vector in the FIPS document, when read from left to right. 
To translate the FIPS 197 notation to an Intel 64 architecture compatible ("Little Endian") format, each test vector needs to be byte-reflected. 
Programs do not need to perform byte-reversal in their code.
