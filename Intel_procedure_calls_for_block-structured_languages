The ENTER (enter procedure) and LEAVE (leave procedure) instructions automatically create and release, respectiviely, stack frames for called procedures. 
The stack frames have predefined spcaes for local variables and the necessary pointers to allow coherent returns from called procedures. 
They also allow scope rules to be implemented so that procedures can access their own local variables and some number of other variables located in other stack frames. 

ENTER and LEAVE offer two benefits: 

1) They provide machine-language support for implementing block-structured languages, such as C and Pascal. 

2) They simplify procedure enter and exit in compiler-generated code.
