MMX technology, SSE extensions, SSE2 extensions, and SSE3 extensions have been introduced into the IA-32 architecture to permit IA-32 processors to perform single instructions multiple data (SIMD) operations. 
MMX instructions operate on packed byte, word, doubleworld, or quadword integer operands contained in memory, in MMX registers, and/or in general-purpose registers. 

Support for the MMX instructions can be detected with the CPUID instructions, But its can only be executed on the INtel 64 and IA-32 processors that support the MMX technology.

MMX instructions are divided into the following subgroups: 

1) Data transfer, 
2) Conversion
3) packed arithmetic 
4) comparison
5) logical 
6) shift
7) rotate
8) state managment instructions
