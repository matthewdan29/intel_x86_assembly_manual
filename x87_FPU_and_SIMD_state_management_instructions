Two state managment instructions were introduced into the IA-32 architecture with Pentium II processor family: 

FXSAVE		Save x87 FPU and SIMD state 

FXRSTOR 	Restore x87 FPU and SIMD state

Initially, these instructions operated only on the x87 FPU (and MMX) registers to perform a fast save and restore, respectively, of the x87 FPU and MMX state. 
With the introduction of SSE extendions in the Pentium II processor family, these instructions were expanded to also save and restore the state of the XMM and MXCSR registers. 
Intel 64 architecture also supports these instructions
