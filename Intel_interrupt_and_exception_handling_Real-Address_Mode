When the processor starts booting the computer, it stats in real mode and operates like a 8086 processor. 
The processor can see up to 1MB of RAM (Random access memory).

The native mode for the processor is the Protected mode. 
The processor switches into Protected mode while it loads Windos or other advanced operating system. 
In protected mode, the processor uses segmented (Non-linear) addressing, as opposed to linear addressing. 
Segmented addressing means that memory (physical and virtual memory) is divided into 64k blocks. 
THis is the max value for the Instruction Pointer (IP) register. 
The IP register works with the Code Segment (CS) register to point to the memory location from where the microprocessor should fetch its next instruction. 
The IP uses 4 bytes for memory addressing, making 0FFFFH  the max memory location (0FFFFH = 64k). 

When Operating in real-address mode, the processor responds to an interrupt or exception with an implicit far call to an interrupt or exception handler. 
The processor uses the interrupt or exception vector as an index into an interrupt table. 
The interrupt table contains instruction pointers to the interrupt and exception handler proceures. 

The processor saves the stat of the EFLAGS register, the EIP register, the CS register, and an optional error code on the stack before switching to the handler procedure.

A return from the interrupt or exception handler is carried out with the IRET instruction.
