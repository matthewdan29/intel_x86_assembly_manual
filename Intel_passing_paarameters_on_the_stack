To pass a large number of parameters to the called procedure, the parameters can be placed on the stack, in the stack frame for the calling procedure. 
Here, it is usedful to use the stack-frame base pointer (in the EBP register) to make a frame boundary for easy access to parameters 

The stack can also be used to pass parameters back from the called procedure to the calling procedure
