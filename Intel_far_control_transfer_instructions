The JMP and CALL instructions both accept a far pointer as a destination to transfer program contrl to a segment other than the segment currently being pointed to by the CS register. 
When a far call is made with the CALL instruction, the current values of the EIP and CS registers are both pushed on the stack. 
The RET instrucion can be used to execute a far return. 
Here, program control is transferred from a code segment that contains a called procedure back to the code segment that contrained the calling procedure. 
The RET instruction restores the value of the CS and EIP registers for the calling procedure from the stack.
