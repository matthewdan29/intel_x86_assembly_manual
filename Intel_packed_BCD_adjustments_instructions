The DAA (decimal adjust after addition) and DAS (decimal adjust after subtraction) instructions adjust the results of operations performed on packed BCD integer. 
Adding two packed BCD values requires two instructions: 
1) An ADD instructions 
2) followed by a DDA instructions

The ADD  instructions add (binary addtion) the two values and stores the result in the AL register. 
The DAA instruction then adjusts the value in the AL register to obtain a valid, 2-digit, packed BCD value and sets the CF flag if a decimal carry occurred as the result of the addition. 

Likewise, subtracting one packed BCD value from another requires a  SUB instrctuion followed by a DAS instruction. 
The SUB instruction subtracts (binary subtraction) one BCD value from another and stores the result in the AL register. 
THe DAS instrcution then adjusts the value in the AL register to obtain a valid, 2-digit, packed BCD value and sets the CF flag if a decimal borrow occurred as the reslt of the subtraction.
