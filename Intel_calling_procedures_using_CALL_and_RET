The CALL instruction allows control transfers to procedures within the current code segment (near call) and in a different code segment (far call). 
Near calls usually provide access to local procedures within the currently running program or task. 
Far calls are usually used to access operating systems procedures or procedures in a different task. 

The RET instruction also allows near and far returns to match the near and far versions of the CALL instructions. 
Also, the RET instrcution allows a program to increment the stack pointer on a return to release parameters from the stack. 
The number of bytes released from the stack is determined by an optional argument (n) to the RET instruciton.
