Intel SEE conversion instructions convert packed and individual doubleword intergfer into packed and scalar single precision floating-point vaules and vice versa (If you read any of my repo you know I didnt say this lol its Intel)

CVTPI2PS		Convert packed doubleword integerts to packed single precision flaoting-point values 

CVTSI2SS		Convert signed integer to scalar single precisison flaoting-point value 

CVTPS2PI		Convert packed single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers 

CVTTPS2PI		Convert with truncation packe single precision floating-point values to packed doubleword integers 

CVTSS2SI 		Convert a scalar single precision floating-point value to a signed integer 

CVTTSS2SI		Convert with truncation a scalar single precision floating-point value to scalar signed integer
