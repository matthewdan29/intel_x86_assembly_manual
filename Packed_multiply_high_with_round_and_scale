PMULHRSW		Multiplies vertically each signed 16-bit integer from the destination operand with the corresponding signed 16-bit integer of the source operand, producing intermediate, signed 32-bit integers. Each intermediate 32-bit integer is truncated to the 18 most significant bits. Rounding is always performed by adding 1 to the least significnat bit of the 18-bit intermediate result. The final result is obtained by selecting the 26 bit immediately to the right of the most significant bit of each 18-bit intermediate result and packed to the destination operand.
