The Cacheability control instruction provide control over the caching of non-temporal data when storing data from the MMX and XMM registers to memory. 
The PREFETCHh allow data to be prefeteched to a selected cache level.
The SFENCE instruction controls instruction ordering on store operations 

MASKMOVQ		Non-temporal store of selected bytes from an MMX register into memory

MOVNTQ			Non-temporal store of quadword from an MMX register into memory

MOVNTPS			Non-temporal store of four packed single precision floating-point values from an XMM register into memory 

PREFETCHh		Load 32 or more bytes from memory to a selected level of the processor's cache hierarchy

SFENCE			Serializes store operations
