Intel SSE2 extensions represents an extension of the SIMD execution model introduced with MMX technology and the Intel SSE extensions. 
Intel SSE2 instructions operate on packed double precision floating-point operands and on packed byte, word, doubleword, and quadword operands located in the XMM registers.

These instructions are divided into four subgroups

1) Packed and scalar double precision floating-point instructions 

2) Packed single precision floating-point conversion instructions 

3) 128-bit SIMD integer instructions 

4) Cacheability-control and instruction orderin instructions
