The XLAT and XLATB (table lookup) instructions replace the contents of the AL register with a byte read from a translation table in memory. 
The initial value in the AL register is interpreted as an unsigned index into the translation table. 
This index is added to the contents of the EBX register (which contains the base address of the tablle) to calculate the addres of the table entry. 
These instrcutions are used for applications such as converting character codes from one alphabet into another
